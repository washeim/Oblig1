<p>To use different semantic tags i looked through the previous lectures and
  youtube videos to prepare. I decided to mainly use h1 and p for my headers
  and main content for my text. That is because I found it the simplest solution.
  I also decided to use ul and ol in my resume page for example. I used mainly
  unordered lists because it didnt really make sense to list them with numbers.
  To use an ordered list I did it for my language list because it was more fitting.
  I used the a href on every page to be able to return to the home page,
   so its easier to navigate back and forth.</p>
